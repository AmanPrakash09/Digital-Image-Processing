# Digital-Image-Processing

-	Used 2D vectors to store pixel data to flip or rotate an image and linked lists to reorder them
-	Employed DFS/BFS algorithms to create a border/fill an enclosed shape on a PNG, producing a GIF
-	Formulated an image pruning strategy using trees, cutting each image node within tolerance to its parent
